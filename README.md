Then create a [composer.json](http://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md) file in your project's root folder

Background Story
----------------

In february 2013 I was looking for a solution to create swiss payment slips for a project I had to do at my work place.
After a short Google search I came across Manuel Reinhard's
[blog post](http://sprain.ch/blog/downloads/class-esr-besr-einzahlungsschein-php/) about the class he made for that.
On his [Github project's page](https://github.com/sprain/class.Einzahlungsschein.php) I found
[Peter Siska's](https://github.com/peschee) [pull request](https://github.com/sprain/class.Einzahlungsschein.php/pull/5).
His pull request introduced PSR-0 compatibility and he created a composer package on [Packagist](http://packagist.org/).
So I tried Peter's version and it suited my basic needs.

BUT since the customer I was working for used custom designed payment slips I couldn't use Manuel's/Peter's script
since it wasn't flexible enough.
Now I had to decide whether I want to "just" change the script to fit my needs or to rewrite it and
make it as flexible as possible.
I decided myself for the latter.

TODOs
